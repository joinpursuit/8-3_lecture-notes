# Preparing for the Module One Assessment

In this directory you will find an assortment of materials covering JavaScript and software engineering concepts to prepare you for the module one assessment. While we suggest moving through the materials in order listed below, it's up to you how to use these activities.

## Open Ended Problems

We recommend starting with these exercises, especially if you are feeling lost or behind.
The exercises in this directory don't contain unit tests: part of the challenge is to determine when you have satisfactorily completed the problem! The main goals of these challenges are to:

- Encourage a tinkering mindset. Come up with theories about your code. Test them by running your code.
- Apply a coherent problem solving methodology. We've used Polya's method a lot in class: practice putting this method to work.
- Flex your data manipulation skills, with an emphasis on primitive data types.
