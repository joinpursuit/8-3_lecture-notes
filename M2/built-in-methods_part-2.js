 * REVIEW ACTIVITY - Part 1

 * This task is important for selecting random elements of an array.
 *
 * Ask yourself: can your algorithm every return the number 30? How about the number 70? How do you know?

 * ACTIVITY 1

 * Try to solve this problem as many ways as possible - aim for 2-3 different approaches!
 *
 * As you work on this problem, you should use goolge and/or MDN to research built in methods and JavaScript features that can help solve this problem.
 *
 * When you have completed 2 or 3 implementations that use different methods, write down your thoughts on the following question
 * (You may have to do more research to answer this!)
 *
 * - Will each function behave the same way with the same inputs? Can you come up with arguments to pass your functions that will result in different outputs?

 *
 * - What is the difference between a for... in loop and a for... of loop?

 * - What are some problems you might experience trying to use Object.values() to solve the previous problem?
